# Design -- Checkout foundations (walking skeleton)

Walking-skeleton design for `work/checkout/01-foundations/`, implementing CHK01 from `docs/product/backlog.md`.

Architecture-wide patterns (server-owned order state, idempotent placement, error taxonomy) are authoritative in `docs/architecture/solution.md` and are not repeated here.

## 1. The slice

Prove one round-trip: cart → place order → confirmation redirect with a trace span and one exercised error path.

## 2. Files shipped

| Path | Label | Purpose |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| `src/...` | NEW | <!-- --> |

## 3. Acceptance gates

### 3.1 End-to-end path

### 3.2 Observability

### 3.3 Error path

### 3.4 Scaffolds and quality gates

## 4. What this WP did NOT deliver

## 5. Open questions closed

## 6. Handoff to next WP
