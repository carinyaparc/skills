# Ralph loop shared hook library.
#
# Sourced by the agent-specific stop hooks:
#   hooks/claude/stop-hook.sh
#   hooks/cursor/ralph-stop.sh
#   hooks/cursor/ralph-capture.sh
#
# DESIGN NOTE: this library deliberately does NOT use `set -e`.
#
# The previous implementation ran `set -euo pipefail` and then immediately
# executed unguarded pipelines such as:
#
#     RALPH_BASE=$(cat ".ralph-loop" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | tr -d '[:space:]')
#
# A missing file made `cat` return 1, `pipefail` propagated it, and `set -e`
# killed the hook before it printed anything. Both Claude Code and Cursor read
# a silent non-zero exit as "allow the stop", so the loop died with no
# diagnostic. Every function below therefore handles its own failures and
# returns a status the caller must check.

# on that line, before or after the tag, disqualifies it). Empty when absent.
# perl is fenced so a failure cannot abort the hook.
#
# The tag must be the last line, not merely present, because a bare substring
# search matches the model MENTIONING its own stop condition:
#   "I will only output <promise>EPIC_DONE</promise> once every task is done."
#   "Reminder: only output `<promise>EPIC_DONE</promise>` when true."
# Anchoring to "alone, on the final line" rejects both — there is always more
# text on that line after the tag in the mention case — while still matching
# the real completion turn, which ends the message on the tag. A *closed*
# fenced quote is rejected too, for the same reason: its last line is the
# closing ``` fence, not the tag.
#
# An UNCLOSED fence needs its own check, because the tag genuinely is the
# last line in that case (there is no closing fence left to disqualify it):
#   "Reminder about the tag:
#   ```
#   <promise>EPIC_DONE</promise>"
# so count fence-marker lines (```) appearing before the matched tag; an odd

# ralph_last_assistant_text <transcript>
#
# Extract the most recent assistant TEXT block from a Claude Code JSONL
# transcript, scoped to the CURRENT turn.
#
# Claude Code writes each content block (text, tool_use, thinking) as its own
# JSONL line, all tagged role=assistant. An earlier implementation took
# `tail -1` of the assistant lines and read text blocks from that single line,
# so any turn ending on a tool call, which is the normal case for a loop that
# delegates every step to a sub-agent, produced no text and the completion
# promise was never seen. The fix after that widened the scan to the last 100
# assistant lines with no turn boundary at all — which meant a stale promise
# left over from an earlier iteration (or an earlier, already-finished loop)
# could be found again by a *fresh* turn that happens to end on tool calls,
# stopping the loop at iteration 1 on a promise nobody made this run.
#
# Every Ralph continuation is a Stop-hook "block" whose `reason` Claude Code
# re-injects as a genuine new user turn: role=user, plain text — never a
# tool_result (those are also role=user, but their content is an array of
# tool_result blocks, never a bare string and never a "text"-type block).
# That is an unambiguous, always-present turn boundary, so scope the scan to
# assistant text after the LAST such real user turn. If none is found in the
# window (the very first turn of a session), boundary defaults to -1, i.e.
# scan the whole window — unchanged behaviour for that case.
#
# A plain-text user turn's `message.content` may be a bare JSON string (the
# simple shape) or an array containing a "text"-type block (used when other
# block types accompany it) — Claude Code has been observed to use either
# depending on context, so a boundary check that only recognised the array
# shape would silently never fire for the (also real) bare-string shape,
# degrading straight back to the pre-fix "scan the whole window" behaviour
# with no error or signal that the boundary was missed. Recognise both.
#
# RALPH_TRANSCRIPT_WINDOW bounds a raw tail over ALL roles (not assistant-only,
# since the boundary line itself may be outside an assistant-only tail), so it
# must comfortably exceed the largest realistic single turn's line count.
