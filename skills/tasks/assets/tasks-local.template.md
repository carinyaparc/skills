TASKS.local.md — machine-written pointer, repo root.
Written once per resolution by any delivery skill after it resolves the work
item source system to Linear or Jira (see references/work-item-resolution.md).
Add this file to .gitignore — it can name environment-specific sites,
workspaces, and project keys.
Do not hand-edit the Source/Site/Project fields; delete the file to force
re-resolution if they go stale.
