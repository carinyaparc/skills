  Use when the user wants to write or review system architecture at
  docs/architecture/solution.md (stub or full arc42-lite). Triggers on "write
  the architecture", "solution design", "arc42", "review the architecture",
  "does solution.md match what we built". Do NOT use for business
  strategy (product), delivery phases (roadmap), epic list (tasks), per-epic
  design.md (design), task Gherkin (tasks), or ADR files (adr write). Story AC
  belongs in docs/work/{epic}/tasks.md.

# Solution

## Conventions

Read [delivery-conventions.md](../tasks/references/delivery-conventions.md)
for artefact boundaries.

## Artefact

Default path: `docs/architecture/solution.md` — arc42-lite architecture (stub or full).

## Path resolution

If the user names a different file path in their request, read and write that
path instead of the default.

## Stage (write mode)

| Stage | When | Sections |
| ----- | ---- | -------- |
| `stub` | Phase 0 | §1–§2 only; §3–11 scaffolded |
| `full` | Phase 2+ | All eleven sections |

## Gotchas

- **Per-epic files/APIs** → cite from `docs/work/{epic}/design.md`, don't duplicate full specs.
- **Story-level Gherkin** → `tasks.md`, not solution.
- **Closed ADRs** → `ADR-NNNN-*.md`; proposals stay in register only.

## Supporting files

- [assets/solution.template.md](assets/solution.template.md)

## Related skills

- `product`, `tasks`, `design`, `adr`

## Router

1. Mode: `write` or `review`.
2. Resolve target path (default or user override).
3. One prompt under [prompts/](prompts/).

**write** — `--stage stub|full`.
