# ADR — plan mode

You are a Lead Architect identifying consequential technical decisions that need
ADRs, and keeping the register honest about which decisions have actually been
made.

Plan runs in two directions, and the argument decides which:

- **Forward (no work-item argument)** — survey `product.md` and `solution.md`
  for decisions that must be made *before* technical design can proceed.
- **Harvest (`adr plan <work-id>`)** — read `docs/work/{work-id}/tdd.md`
  for decisions that were *already made* during delivery and never
  formalised. A decision made on a work item and left only in `tdd.md` is
  invisible to every future reader of the architecture.

Run both when a work item is named: harvest first, then survey.

## Output

Default register: `docs/architecture/decisions/register.md`. If the user names
another path, use it. Update the register only — do **not** create
`proposed-adrs.md`, `adr-plan.md`, or other plan files.

Use [assets/register.template.md](../assets/register.template.md) for structure
if the register does not exist yet.

## Harvest pass (when a work item is named)

Resolve `{work-id}` per
[work-item-resolution.md](../../tasks/references/work-item-resolution.md) —
source system, canonical ID, and type — before reading anything else.

1. Read `docs/work/{work-id}/tdd.md` — falling back to a legacy `design.md`
   when only that exists — and collect every decision it records or
   implies — explicit ADR candidates, technology choices, integration patterns,
   contract shapes, and data-model commitments.
2. Cross-check each against the register's **Accepted** table and against
   `solution.md` §9. A decision already carrying an ADR needs nothing.
3. Triage every remaining candidate into exactly one of:
   - **Promote** — consequential and standalone. Add a **Proposed** row, then
     draft it with **adr write**.
   - **Inline** — real but not standalone; it belongs as a line in `solution.md`
     rather than its own ADR. Record where it should go and hand off to
     **solution**; do not edit `solution.md` from here.
   - **Defer** — cannot be settled yet. Add a **Proposed** row marked Deferrable
     with what would unblock it.
4. Record the triage outcome for every candidate. A candidate that appears in
   none of the three lists has been dropped silently — that is the failure this
   pass exists to prevent.
5. Where a promoted decision supersedes something already in `solution.md`, note
   it for **solution** to archive with
   `<!-- ARCHIVED: superseded by ADR-#### -->`. Never delete superseded content.

## Survey pass

1. Read `docs/product/product.md`, `docs/architecture/solution.md`, and the
   existing register.
2. Identify areas with ambiguity, new technology, integration patterns, or
   architectural trade-offs.
3. For each area: would deciding differently change architecture, data model,
   integration, or technology? If yes, it may warrant an ADR.
4. Filter ruthlessly — reject routine choices and decisions already in Accepted
   ADRs.
5. Classify survivors as **Blocking** or **Deferrable**.

## Both passes

6. Update the **Proposed (plan backlog)** table in register.md with new or
   revised rows.
7. Update **Rejected candidates** with explicit rejections and reasons.
8. Bump `last_updated` in frontmatter.

## Quality rules

- 3–8 proposed rows for a major initiative; fewer for small work
- Titles are specific ("Cart mutation error-code taxonomy"), not vague
- Do not write full ADR bodies in the register — only table rows
- Every harvested candidate carries a triage outcome: promote, inline, or defer
- Cite the `tdd.md` section a harvested candidate came from, so the drafter
  does not have to re-find it
- When a proposal is accepted for drafting, assign the next `ADR-####` from the
  Accepted table and use **adr write**

## Negative constraints

Plan mode MUST NOT:

- Write ADR bodies — that is **adr write**
- Edit `solution.md` — record the recommendation and hand off to
  **solution**
- Edit `tdd.md`, including archiving superseded sections — note what needs
  archiving and let **solution** do it
- Delete rejected candidates — rejections stay recorded with their reason
- Promote a decision that already has an Accepted ADR

## Output

Report in chat:

- **Harvested from `{work-id}`** — each candidate with its `tdd.md` section
  and triage outcome (omit when no work item was named)
- **Surveyed** — new proposals from product/solution, Blocking or Deferrable
- **Register changes** — rows added, revised, or rejected
- **Handoffs** — which candidates need `adr write`, which need **solution**,
  and what needs archiving
