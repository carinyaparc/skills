description: >
  Use when the user wants ADR register planning, writing ADR-NNNN files, or ADR
  review under docs/architecture/decisions/. Triggers on "do we need an ADR",
  "write ADR-0007", "record this decision", "what decisions need making",
  "harvest ADRs from this epic", "harvest ADRs from JIRA-123". Do NOT use for
  full architecture narrative (solution), work-item technical design (tdd), or
  product strategy (product). Proposals stay in register.md only until
  accepted.

compatibility: Tracker resolution (plan mode, when a work-id is named) uses Linear, Atlassian (Jira), or GitHub/GitLab MCP tools when available, or `git remote`/`gh`/`glab`; falls back to the filesystem when none are reachable.

# ADR

## Paths

| Artefact | Default path |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Register | `docs/architecture/decisions/register.md` |
| ADR document | `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-{NUMBER}-{short-title}.md` |

## Path resolution

If the user names a different directory or file path in their request, use it
for read/write instead of the defaults. Keep `ADR-####` numbering sequential
within the register the user targets.

## Supporting files

- [assets/register.template.md](assets/register.template.md)
- [assets/adr.template.md](assets/adr.template.md)

## Router

1. Mode: `plan`, `write`, or `review`.
2. Resolve paths (default or user override).
   **plan** takes an optional work item: `adr plan <work-id>` resolves it per
   [work-item-resolution.md](../tasks/references/work-item-resolution.md),
   harvests decisions already made in `docs/work/{work-id}/tdd.md`, and
   triages them into the register. Without a work item it surveys product.md
   and solution.md for decisions still to be made.
3. [prompts/plan.prompt.md](prompts/plan.prompt.md) | [prompts/write.prompt.md](prompts/write.prompt.md) | [prompts/review.prompt.md](prompts/review.prompt.md).
